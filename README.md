Model Predictive Control with Supervisory Substrate Targeting for Multi-Setpoint Biomass Control in Continuous Bioprocesses.

This repository implements an experimentally validated non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) and extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for a continuous stirred bioreactor.
This NMPC formulation uses multiple-shooting with a fourth order Runge Kutta Fehlberg integrator.
